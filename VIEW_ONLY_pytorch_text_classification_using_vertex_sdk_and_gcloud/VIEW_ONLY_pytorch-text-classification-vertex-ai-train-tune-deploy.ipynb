I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\\'t have much of a plot.',\n",

ARKADIN and any other film the director didn't manage to save from the clutches of studio bosses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six years after THE MALTESE FALCON, with the post-war craze of the film noir in full swing, Welles, always ahead of his time, a true visionary director of tremendous artistic integrity, envisioned a labyrinthine world of shadows that is already darker, more sinister, paranoid and serpentine than anything his contemporaries were doing at the time. It's no wonder the movie was so misunderstood at its time, to the point that one full hour of footage was forever left in the cutting room floor, and it was once again Europe that championed it as another Welles classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain set-pieces stand out. The aquarium scene with its flickering light and ominous shadows, and of course the Funhouse/Hall of Mirrors finale that is as classic a piece of Wellesian bravura as any in CITIZEN KANE or THE TRIAL. The only faults I find with the movie is Welles' ill-advised Irish accent and perhaps some of the erratic editing in the first act. The story however unfurls in a progressively mesmerizing manner, which the cuts only serve to intensify. I believe the heavily chopped versions of Shangai and Ambersons attain a surreal quality for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welles would exile himself in Europe for ten years and return in 1958 to deliver yet another stonewall classic, the monumental TOUCH OF EVIL, perhaps the crowning jewel of the film noir that was already in its waning days by that time. Shangai was not the box office success a star vehicle for Hollywood's premiere star of the time, Rita Hayworth, ought to have been, and Welles marriage with Hayworth ended before the movie was even released. Sixty years later and one hour of footage less, Shangai is still one of the best film noir pictures one is likely to discover. Surely that must count for something.</td>\n",

The movie stands out for the classical touch given to the romance of the engaged couple. Thankfully this time all Indian locales like Ranikhet Almora etc have been used, which have been already visited by most of the urbanites, hence adding to the connection with movie. The dialogues are much better than those in the \"Umrao Jaan Ada\" - a supposedly dialogue based movie. The background music is augmenting the \"soft focus\" of the movie. It somehow remind me of VV Chopra's \"Kareeb\", in which neha and to some extent Bobby did full justice to the character. Same here, in that the lead pair does not disappoint in any department-looks or acting. The Supporting cast are too good. I rate the actress playing the role of Bhabhi in the front league. The situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters. Songs were too suiting the scenes and going along well with the movie. However, though I respect Ravindra Jain for his body of work from movies to Ramayana, I missed Ram Laxman badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had no double entendres(Sivan category), no bikinis, no intrigue, and no nonsense. You would comfortably watch the movie with your parents except if you're already or going to be soon engaged. I want to express on candid thing here that though Suraj proposes that the marriages is between families and not only individuals, his approach is totally individualistic. The movie is only about Prem &amp; Poonam, rest of the characters are incidental. Art immitating life? The \"peripheral characters\" are consigned to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming back, Everything was almost great. Except, for the drama part. The situation of tragedy was artificially created. The outcome, the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not compelling at all. That is why it lacks the emotional punch-the very purpose of this turn of events. But, a twist in the tale was necessary to transcend the movie from a beautiful pre-marital video to a 'feature film'. But I kept waiting for the punch and it never came. The preaching by Mohnish Bahal and later by Alok Nath on dowry was out of place and it made things too overboard. May be this will help the movie a tax-free status. But the plot could have been made more interesting and non-linear than what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were too question in my mind when the movie ended: 1 Has the movie really ended? 2 Has the movie ended?</td>\n",

    "You can do local experimentation on your Notebooks instance. However, for larger datasets or models often a vertically scaled compute or horizontally distributed training is required. The most effective way to perform this task is to leverage [Vertex AI custom training service](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/custom-training) for following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automatically provision and de-provision resources**: Training job on Vertex AI will automatically provision computing resources, performs the training task and ensures deletion of compute resources once the training job is finished.\n",
    "- **Reusability and portability**: You can package training code with its parameters and dependencies into a container and create a portable component. This container can then be run with different scenarios such as hyperparameter tuning, different data sources and more.\n",
    "- **Training at scale**: You can run a [distributed training job](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/distributed-training) with AI allowing you to train models in a cluster across multiple nodes in parallel and resulting in faster training time. \n",
    "- **Logging and Monitoring**: The training service logs messages from the job to [Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs) and can be monitored while the job is running.\n",

There are three steps to run a training job using [Vertex AI custom training service](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/custom-training):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STEP 1**: Determine training code structure - Packaging as a Python source distribution or as a custom container image\n",

    "- **[Hyperparameter tuning jobs](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/using-hyperparameter-tuning):** Hyperparameter tuning jobs automate tuning of hyperparameters of your model based on the criteria you configure such as goal/metric to optimize, hyperparameters values and number of trials to run.\n",

    "Deploying a PyTorch model on [Vertex AI Predictions](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/getting-predictions) requires to use a custom container that serves online predictions. You will deploy a container running [PyTorch's TorchServe](https://pytorch.org/serve/) tool in order to serve predictions from a fine-tuned transformer model from Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment analysis task. You can then use Vertex AI Predictions to classify sentiment of input texts. \n",

    "\n",
    "To use a custom container to serve predictions from a PyTorch model, you must provide Vertex AI with a Docker container image that runs an HTTP server, such as TorchServe in this case.

    "When predicting sentiments of the input text with the fine-tuned transformer model, it requires pre-processing of the input text and post-processing by adding name (positive/negative) to the target label (1/0) along with probability (or confidence). We create a custom handler script that is packaged with the model artifacts and TorchServe executes the code when it runs. \n",
